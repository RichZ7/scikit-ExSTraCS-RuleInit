Instructions to run for Alexa


1) Make sure to have all necessary modules installed (h2o is the main one to check)

2) Download the rfi_skExSTraCS folder from the github and move the folder to the directory in which the main script will be run

3) Install all of the python modules within the experiment files folder and move them to the same dir in which rfi_skExSTraCS is in

4) Download the datasets folder and make sure that the folder is specifically named "datasets" (necessary for script to locate datasets)
   paths to datasets should resemble something like "datasets/two_way_epi/*.txt" where "*" stands for any/all files
   
5) Confirm that no directory called "Results" exists, (if ran multiple times, change the name of or delete the "old" Results folder)

6) Run main.py
