# scikit-ExSTraCS-RuleInit

The scikit-ExSTraCS-RuleInit repository includes (1) a python file showing how to import an initial rule populaiton prior to the start of ExStraCS learning iterations, which allows for the import of manually curated expert knowledge derived rules, and (2) a python file with a Random Forest Initialized Learning Classifier System (RFI-LCS), which converts branches from a Random Forest model to rules used to intialize ExSTraCS. RFI-LCS is an experimental algorithm that is under active development and testing. 

Please see the scikit-ExSTraCS package for more details about ExSTraCS.
